In spring-summer 2024 I tried to start a monthly review on my Substack. It was supposed to be analogous to the monthly "[links](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/links-for-april-2024)" posts on Astral Codex Ten or Keller Scholl's "[Monthly Shorts](https://keller.substack.com/archive)".  The idea was to review all the blog posts I've published on Substack or [Medium](https://moreisdifferent.medium.com/) along with my top posts from my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielelton/) and [X](https://x.com/moreisdifferent). I also wanted to review top stuff I'd read elsewhere. 

I published two montly reviews, but they weren't very popular, and I lost subscribers on both. So I became disenchanted with the concept. 

This post was supposed to be for June 2024 but it was never published. It's archived here for posterity:

Bonus section - news & articles I read in January 2024
------------------------------------------------------

[**Japan landed on the moon**](https://www.space.com/japan-slim-moon-lander-awake-after-hibernation) - there was a cool little [spheroidal robot](https://www.space.com/jaxa-slim-moon-lander-lev-2-ball-robot).

[**Big scandal at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston**](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/dana-farber-cancer-institute-boston-harvard-data-manipulation-claims/) - 6 papers published by their researchers are being retracted and 31 corrected after a data sleuth found tons of evidence of image manipulation. It's mostly the photoshopping of images of western blots, and whereas some of it might be in error... lots of it is obviously fraud. There might be more to come. It is, to quote Derek Lowe, "[a disgrace](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/stop-hocusing-your-western-blots-maybe)" - and that's at one of the top research institutions in the US!

[**Large language models cannot generalize "A is B" to "B is A"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288) (related [twitter thread](https://x.com/OwainEvans_UK/status/1705285631520407821?s=20)). The researchers christen it the "reversal curse". As [I said on Twitter](https://x.com/moreisdifferent/status/1705318782523109743?s=20), this is yet another way LLMs are weird aliens. While humans have a similar issue in memory recall, this points to a severe deficit in reasoning which I suspect will not be easily remedied just by scaling to larger models and more data.

[**10 emerging antidepressants to keep an eye on**](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/10-emerging-antidepressants-to-keep-an-eye-on/?fbclid=IwAR0sdlh8vDln8NCexpKXIV_XrZBNVzpIQBK1hQq3Q6zQaoBAGpPBnezdEwg) **-** very interesting to read about potential new treatments. List includes esmethadone, r-ketamine, and psilocybin. Interestingly, an ultra-short acting (2-3 hour half life) orexin antagonist has also made the list --- Seltorexant. It is under development for "major depressive disorder with insomnia symptoms".

[**An Enormous Gravity 'Hum' Moves Through the Universe**](https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-enormous-gravity-hum-moves-through-the-universe-20230628/) **-** It turns out that scientists have been carefully monitoring pulsars across our galaxy for decades now, noting tiny shifts in timing over time between them. These waves have an insanely long wavelength: "Whereas LIGO's waves might vibrate a few hundred times a second, it might take years or decades for a single one of these gravitational waves to pass by at the speed of light." It is believed that they are due to supermassive black holes orbiting each other, however they could also be due to more exotic phenomena like cosmic strings.

[**Private Bard conversations accidentally leaked out by Google.**](https://venturebeat.com/ai/oops-google-search-caught-publicly-indexing-users-conversations-with-bard-ai/) Users who shared Bard conversations with friends and colleagues were taken by surprise when they realized that these interactions are now searchable via Google.
