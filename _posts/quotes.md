<br>
not sure why these are here, but here's a long rant by Ayn Rand: <br>
h<br>
I am referring here to romantic love, in the serious meaning of that term�as
distinguished from the superficial infatuations of those whose sense of life is
devoid of any consistent values, <i lang="la">i.e.</i>, of any lasting emotions
other than fear. Love is a response to values. It is with a person�s sense of
life that one falls in love�with that essential sum, that fundamental stand or
way of facing existence, which is the essence of a personality. One falls in
love with the embodiment of the values that formed a person�s character, which
are reflected in his widest goals or smallest gestures, which create the <em>
style</em> of his soul�the individual style of a unique, unrepeatable,
irreplaceable consciousness. It is one�s own sense of life that acts as the
selector, and responds to what it recognizes as one�s own basic values in the
person of another. It is not a matter of professed convictions (though these are
not irrelevant); it is a matter of much more profound, conscious <em>and
subconscious</em> harmony<br>
Many errors and tragic disillusionments are possible in this process of
emotional recognition, since a sense of life, by itself, is not a reliable
cognitive guide. And if there are degrees of evil, then one of the most evil
consequences of mysticism�in terms of human suffering�is the belief that love is
a matter of �the heart,� not the mind, that love is an emotion independent of
reason, that love is blind and impervious to the power of philosophy. Love is
<em>the expression of philosophy</em>�of a subconscious philosophical sum�and,
perhaps, no other aspect of human existence needs the <em>conscious</em> power
of philosophy quite so desperately. When that power is called upon to verify and
support an emotional appraisal, when love is a conscious integration of reason
and emotion, of mind and values, then�and only then�it is the greatest reward of
man�s life. -Ayn Rand <br>

<p>Let us answer the question: �Can you measure love?�
<p>The concept �love� is formed by isolating two or more instances of the
appropriate psychological process, then retaining its distinguishing
characteristics (an emotion proceeding from the evaluation of an existent as a
positive value and as a source of pleasure) and omitting the object and the
measurements of the process�s intensity.
<p>The object may be a thing, an event, an activity, a condition or a person.
The intensity varies according to one�s evaluation of the object, as, for
instance, in such cases as one�s love for ice cream, or for parties, or for
reading, or for freedom, or for the person one marries. The concept �love�
subsumes a vast range of values and, consequently, of intensity: it extends from
the lower levels (designated by the subcategory �liking�) to the higher level
(designated by the subcategory �affection,� which is applicable only in regard
to persons) to the highest level, which includes romantic love.
<p>If one wants to measure the intensity of a particular instance of love, one
does so by reference to the hierarchy of values of the person experiencing it. A
man may love a woman, yet may rate the neurotic satisfactions of sexual
promiscuity higher than her value to him. Another man may love a woman, but may
give her up, rating his fear of the disapproval of others (of his family, his
friends or any random strangers) higher than her value. Still another man may
risk his life to save the woman he loves, because all his other values would
lose meaning without her. The emotions in these examples are not emotions of the
same intensity or dimension. Do not let a James Taggart type of mystic tell you
that love is immeasurable.

Science simply doesn�t deal

At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an
intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are
experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that <span class="SpellE">
Hindoos, <span class="SpellE">Mahomadans and others might argue in
the same manner and with equal force in <span class="SpellE">favour of
the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the <span class="SpellE">
Buddists of no God. There are also many barbarian tribes who cannot be
said with any truth to believe in what we call God: they believe indeed in
spirits or ghosts, and it can be explained, as Tyler and Herbert Spencer have
shown, how such a belief would be likely to arise.
<span style>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to, (although
I do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed in me),
to the firm conviction of the existence of God, and of the immortality of the
soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of
a Brazilian forest, �it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher
feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind.� I
well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of
his body. But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and
feelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man who has
become <span class="SpellE">colour-blind, and the universal belief by men
of the existence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the least
value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races
had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God; but we know that
this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward
convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.
The state of mind which grand scenes formerly excited in me, and which was
intimately connected with a belief in God, did not essentially differ from that
which is often called the sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to
explain the genesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for
the existence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar
feelings excited by music.
� Charles Darwin
&nbsp;To invoke God as a blanket
explanation of the unexplained is to make God the friend of ignorance. If God is
to be found, it must surely be through what we discover about the world, not
what we fail to discover.
� Paul Davies
In a universe of electrons
and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people
are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won�t find
any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has
precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no
purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.
� Richard Dawkins
&nbsp;
I think it�s important to
realize that when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal
intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them. It
is possible for one side to be simply wrong.

Science shares with religion
the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and
the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by
evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not.
� Richard Dawkins
&nbsp;
If you have a faith, it is
statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents
and grandparents had. No doubt soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving
stories and parables, help a bit. But by far the most important variable
determining your religion is the accident of birth. The convictions that you so
passionately believe would have been a completely different, and largely
contradictory, set of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a
different place. <span class="GramE">Epidemiology, not evidence.

Mystery generates wonder, and wonder generates awe. The gasp can terrify or the

<p>&quot;How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief
sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it.
But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for
other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own
happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose
destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I
remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men,
living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same
measure as I have received and am still receiving... <br>
&quot;I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this
critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my
way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have
been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like
mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally
unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have
seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward
success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible. <br>
&quot;My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always
contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other
human beings and human communities. I am truly a 'lone traveler' and have never
belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with
my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of
distance and a need for solitude...&quot;
<p>-from &quot;The World as I See It&quot;, by Albert Einstein
<p align="justify"><font size="3"></b>My Credo</b><i> (1932</i>)</font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">&quot;It is a special blessing to belong among
those who can and may devote their best energies to the contemplation and
exploration of objective and timeless things. How happy and grateful I am for
having been granted this blessing, which bestows upon one a large measure of
independence from one's personal fate and from the attitude of one's
contemporaries. Yet this independence must not inure us to the awareness of the
duties that constantly bind us to the past, present and future of humankind at
large.<br>
Our situation on this earth seems strange. Every one of us appears here,
involuntarily and uninvited, for a short stay, without knowing the why and the
wherefore. In our daily lives we feel only that man is here for the sake of
others, for those whom we love and for many other beings whose fate is connected
with our own. I am often troubled by the thought that my life is based to such a
large extent on the work of my fellow human beings, and I am aware of my great
indebtedness to them.<br>
I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants,
but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations throughout my
life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather
painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking
myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and
from losing my temper.<br>
I have never coveted affluence and luxury and even despise them a good deal. My
passion for social justice has often brought me into conflict with people, as
has my aversion to any obligation and dependence I did not regard as absolutely
necessary. I have a high regard for the individual and an insuperable distaste
for violence and fanaticism. All these motives have made me a passionate
pacifist and antimilitarist. I am against any chauvinism, even in the guise of
mere patriotism.<br>
Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and
pernicious, as does any exaggerated personality cult. I am an adherent of the
ideal of democracy, although I know well the weaknesses of the democratic form
of government. Social equality and economic protection of the individual have
always seemed to me the important communal aims of the state.<br>
Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to

The most beautiful and deepest experience a man can have is the sense of the
mysterious. It is the underlying principle of religion as well as of all serious
endeavor in art and science. He who never had this experience seems to me, if
not dead, then at least blind. To sense that behind anything that can be
experienced there is a something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and
sublimely reaches us only indirectly: this is religiousness. In this sense I am
religious. To me it suffices to wonder at these secrets and to attempt humbly to
grasp with my mind a mere image of the lofty structure of all there is.&quot;<br>
-Albert Einstein&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human
beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least
partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this
world beckoned like <span class="GramE">a liberation�The road to this
paradise was not as comforting and alluring as the road to the religious
paradise; but it has proved itself as trustworthy, and I have never regretted
having chosen it.<br>
� Albert Einstein&nbsp;</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The further the spiritual evolution of
mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine
religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and
blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.<br>

<p>&quot;Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means
nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction
between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.&quot; <br>
-Albert Einstein -- referring to the death of a fellow physicist
<p>&quot;One had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether
one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect on me that, after
I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific
problems distasteful to me for an entire year.&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt.
He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would
surely suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once.
Heroism at command, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble
war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action. It
is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of
murder.&quot; <br>

You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt
and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it�s much more interesting to live not
knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers
and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different
things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I
don�t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we�re
here�I don�t have to know an answer. I don�t feel frightened not knowing things,
by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it
really is as far as I can tell. It doesn�t frighten me.<br>
� Richard P. Feynman</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">A poet once said, �The whole universe is in
a glass of wine.� We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for
poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass
of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of
physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather,
the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a
distillation of the earth�s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of
the universe�s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange <span class="GramE">
array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are
the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is
found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover
the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of
much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the
consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide
this glass of wine, this universe, into parts � physics, biology, geology,
astronomy, psychology, and so on � remember that nature does not know it! So let
us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it
give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!<br>
� Richard P. Feynman&nbsp;</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Poets say science takes away from the beauty
of the stars � mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is �<span class="GramE">mere.�
I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or
more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination � stuck on this
carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern � of
which I am a part � perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as
one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What
is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery
to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists
of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men
are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an
immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">
We have a way of discussing the world, when we talk of it at various
hierarchies, or levels. Now I do not mean to be very precise, dividing the world
into definite levels, but I will indicate, by describing a set of ideas, what I
mean by hierarchies of ideas.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">For example, at one end we have the
fundamental laws of physics. Then we invent other terms for concepts which are
approximate, which have, we believe, their ultimate explanation in terms of the
fundamental laws. For instance, �heat.� Heat is supposed to be jiggling, and the
word for a hot thing is just the word for a mass of atoms which are jiggling.
But for a while, if we are talking about heat, we sometimes forget about the
atoms jiggling � just as when we talk about the glacier we do not always think
of the hexagonal ice and the snowflakes which originally fell. Another example
of the same thing is a salt crystal. Looked at fundamentally it is a lot of
protons, neutrons, and electrons; but we have this concept of �salt crystal,�
which carries a whole pattern already of fundamental interactions. An idea like
pressure is the same.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Now if we go higher up from this, in
another level we have properties of substances � like �refractive index,� how
light is bent when it goes through something; or �surface tension,� the fact
that water tends to pull itself together, both of which are described by
numbers. I remind you that we have to go through several laws down to find out
that it is the pull of the atoms, and so on. But we still say �surface tension,�
and do not always worry, when discussing surface tension, about the inner
workings.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">On, up in the hierarchy. With the water
we have waves, and we have a thing like a storm, the word �storm� which
represents an enormous mass of phenomena, or a �sun spot,� or �star,� which is
an accumulation of things. And it is not worthwhile always to think of it way
back. In fact we cannot, because the higher up we go the more steps we have in
between, each one of which is a little weak. We have not thought them all
through yet.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we go up in this hierarchy of complexity, we get to things
like muscle twitch, or nerve impulse, which is an enormously complicated thing
in the physical world, involving an organization of matter in a very elaborate
complexity. Then <span class="GramE">come things like �frog.�<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we go on, and we come to words and concepts like
�man,� and �history,� or �political expediency,� and so forth, a series of
concepts which we use to understand things at an ever higher level.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going on, we come to things like evil, and beauty, and
hope�<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which end is nearer to God, if I may use a religious
metaphor, beauty and hope, or the fundamental laws? I think that the right way,
of course, is to say that what we have to look at is the whole structural
interconnection of the thing; and that all the sciences, and not just the
sciences but all the efforts of intellectual kinds, are an <span class="SpellE">
endeavor to see the connections of the hierarchies, to connect beauty to
history, to connect history to man�s psychology, man�s psychology to the working
of the brain, the brain to the neural impulse, the neural impulse to the
chemistry, and so forth, up and down, both ways. And today we cannot, and it is
no use making believe that we can, draw carefully a line all the way from one
end of this thing to the other, because we have only just begun to see that
there is this relative hierarchy.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I do not think either end is nearer to God. To stand at
either end, and to walk off that end of the pier only, hoping that out in that
direction is the complete understanding, is a mistake. And to stand with evil
and beauty and hope, or to stand with the fundamental laws, hoping that way to
get a deep understanding of the whole world, with that aspect alone, is a
mistake. It is not sensible for the ones who specialize at the other end, to
have such disregard for each other. (They don�t actually, but people say they
do.) The great mass of workers in between, connecting one step to another, are
improving all the time our understanding of the world, both from working at the
ends and working in the middle, and in that way we are gradually understanding
this tremendous world of interconnecting hierarchies.<br>
