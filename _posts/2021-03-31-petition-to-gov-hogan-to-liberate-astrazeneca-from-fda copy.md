*Note from the Authors: This was an op-ed we wrote in the first week of February 2021. Unfortunately, no newspaper wanted to publish it. We first submitted it to the Baltimore Sun, which promptly turned it down. We then submitted it to the Capitol Gazette, The Washington Times, and The Washington Examiner but never heard back from any of them. Sadly, this op-ed is just as relevant today as when we first wrote it almost two months ago. Since it was written, the evidence for the safety and efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine has only gotten stronger. An [observational study of millions of people in Scotland](https://archive.is/rwMH5) published in early March found that a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine offers ~94% protection against hospitalization, outperforming Pfizer's vaccine, which offered ~85% protection. Last week AstraZeneca reached an endpoint in the Phase III trial in the United States that the FDA requested, [finding an efficacy of 76%](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html), very similar to the previous Phase III trial result (70%). Despite all this, there has been no action from the FDA,and millions of AstraZeneca doses remain languishing in factories in [Baltimore, Maryland](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/the-astrazeneca-factory-in-baltimore.html) and [West Chester, Ohio](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html) as thousands of American taxpayers that are desperate for them die every day.*

If Maryland Governor Larry Hogan acts immediately and decisively, he can save thousands of Marylanders from suffering and death from COVID-19. A facility in Baltimore produces the very effective AstraZeneca vaccine and has stockpiled millions of doses. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, headquartered in suburban Maryland, which must certify all vaccines and medical treatments before patients can reap their benefits, is holding those doses hostage to its antiquated, bureaucratic red tape. Hogan should act now to liberate the vaccine to save the lives of Marylanders.

Over a year into the pandemic, over 8,200 Marylanders have died, and some 410,000 have suffered from COVID-19. Marylanders have suffered from a chronic shortage of the FDA-approved Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca is approved in the E.U. and 19 other countries. So as our morgues fill up, what's the FDA's excuse for delay?

The AstraZeneca vaccine has passed Phase I and [Phase II efficacy](http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32466-1/fulltext) trials, which were published in the medical journal *The Lancet* in July and November 2020. A [Phase III peer-reviewed study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext) that was conducted in three other countries indicates the vaccine has an efficacy of 70 percent, ranging from 62 percent to 90 percent with different dosages. Most importantly, the vaccine showed a 100-percent efficacy at preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. The AstraZeneca vaccine was also the first [shown in a scientific study to reduce transmission](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777268). And unlike the two already-approved vaccines, it requires only regular rather than ultra-cold refrigeration. It has been given to over one million people in the U.K. without safety issues detected, yet FDA has requested that AstraZeneca redo most of their Phase III trials using patients from the U.S.

Some media outlets have reported that AstraZeneca's vaccine "may not work" in the elderly. Unfortunately, AstraZeneca's Phase III data published so far does not allow for efficacy to be determined for those older than 65. However, Phase I & II trials showed a similar immune response after the second dose across all age groups, including those over 65, so there are good reasons to believe the efficacy should be similar for the elderly. Even if the efficacy is much lower, because the elderly are at such high risk it still makes sense to give them the vaccine in order to save lives. This was shown clearly by Oxford bioethicists Jonathan Pugh and Julian Savulescu, who [ran some numbers](https://theconversation.com/not-recommending-astrazeneca-vaccine-for-the-elderly-risks-the-lives-of-the-most-vulnerable-154605) to show the grave consequences of denying the vaccine to the elderly. It is also true that recent results show the AstraZeneca vaccine is not very effective against the South African variant at preventing mild forms of COVID-19. However, the current study only addressed mild illness and AstraZeneca's vaccine gives a similar immune response to Pfizer's vaccine, which has been shown to protect strongly against hospitalization from the South African variant. The World Health Organization recently [released guidance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-AZD1222-2021.1/) recommending the rollout of the vaccine not be halted due to this finding and that the vaccine be given to all age groups. 

The U.S. government [has already contracted for 300 million doses](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca/u-s-secures-300-million-doses-of-potential-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN22X0J9) of the vaccine, costing taxpayers over $1 billion. Yet with thousands dying daily and many more suffering from COVID-19 across the county, the FDA projects they won't approve the vaccine until late April.  

Since FDA won't certify the AstraZeneca vaccine immediately, Governor Hogan should act. He might invoke emergency authority to simply take possession of enough of the AstraZeneca vaccine supply in the [Baltimore factory producing it ](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-pr-hs-making-more-vaccine-20210129-5dmn7hxib5dm3hyuiohxb7iibe-story.html)to meet Maryland's needs. But this would likely be unnecessary. He should request that the facility release the vaccine and inform them that the state will likely be able to guarantee no adverse repercussions from the FDA. After all, during the past decade over 40 states passed "Right To Try" laws that allowed terminally ill patients to access safe treatments not certified by FDA for efficacy. The only "repercussion": in 2018 Congress passed bipartisan legislation, signed by President Trump, recognizing the state's authority to do so. 

But in parallel, Hogan should call on President Biden to issue an executive order suspending the need for final FDA certification in this exceptional case.

Or Biden, backed strongly by the Maryland Congressional delegation, could request Congress pass emergency legislation creating a [Free To Choose Medicine](https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/TEDDPaper.pdf) track parallel to FDA's normal, slow certification process, on which COVID vaccines, tested safe and promising in Phase II or III trials, could be accessed by individuals, with informed consent. Such a track was created in 1992 [for AIDS treatments](https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/ParallelTrackPB.pdf), saving the lives of thousands of sufferers.

Or Biden could request Congress pass a reciprocity law certifying for the use of Americans any COVID treatment approved  in other advanced countries. Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21) and Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-TX) have [introduced legislation](https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/roy-reintroduces-legislation-improve-americans-access-lifesaving-medicine) allowing for reciprocal approval of drugs approved in other trusted countries. This proposal could be focused to allow access to COVID vaccines.

Since AstraZeneca is produced in Maryland and the FDA headquarters is also in Maryland, Hogan is in an ideal position to be the hero, shake things up, and break the bureaucratic walls separating citizens from a lifesaving treatment.
