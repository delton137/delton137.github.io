<font size="4">A List of Some Electronic Albums I've Listened to in Times Past<br>
</font><br>
I don't really listen to electronic music anymore, for various reasons, but 
while I was into it I started compiling this list, so I figured I'd edit it a 
bit and post it here. For completeness I ended up listing all of the electronic albums I've ever listened to.<br>
<br>
</b>Items highlighted in yellow are important/recommended , items highlighted in 
orange are highly recommended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Abe Fenton - <i>Advanced<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Minamalism&nbsp; / slow progressive drumming<br>
3/5 This is epic minimalism. But it does fall into the trap of being utterly 
stupefying. It would make good hard-core clubbing music, though.&nbsp; </font>
<br>
<br>
<b>Ace of Base - <i>Greatest Hits <br>
</i></b><font size="2">Europop -- 90s<br>
4/5 : This album is mostly crap remixes, but the songs &quot;Beautiful Life&quot;, &quot;Hallo 
Hallo&quot; and &quot;The Sign&quot; are all europop / eurodance classics and perennial 
favorites at social gatherings. Recommended for anyone surveying Eurodance.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Age of Love - <i>Age of Love<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Classic trance<br>
<br>
</font><b>Akufen - <i>Architextures </i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Ambient house<br>
3.8/5 -- semi decent ambient house, but kindof boring. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
</span><b>Agalaia - <i>Three Organic Experiences<span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
</span></i></b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Ambient<br>
3/5 This is the true unadulterated ambient experience. It's really long and 
subtle, and I just didn't have the time to get into it.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Akufen</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> -
</span> <i><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">My Way</span></i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Microhouse &nbsp;<br>
4.6/5 : This is very interesting. Microhouse is music made from short sound samples 
(&lt;1sec).<br>
<br>
</span><b>Amethystium - <i>Evermind </i>(2004)<br>
</b><font size="2">Ambient electronica </font>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">/ new age<br>
3.5/5 This is very listenable &quot;ambient&quot;, in that it stays engaging, yet retains 
ambient qualities. Has a sort of of a vague &quot;celtic&quot; feel to it for some reason, 
probably due to the female vocals and incorporation of instruments, which is 
always nice. Like a more mellow, more ethnically infused version of Future Sound 
of London.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</span><b><span style="background-color: #FF9933">Andy Hunter - </span><i>
<span style="background-color: #FF9933">Go</span><br>
</i></b><font size="2">Breakcore / techno / stadium techno / vocal trance / 
electronic mix / Christian electronic<br>
5/5: this is an epic album, the one that got me hooked on electronic music. This 
guy is a genius and totally not fully respected, perhaps because an overall lack 
of originality. But the originators are not always the best! This guy perfected 
complex mash-ups. There is not a single dull moment in this entire album.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Andy Hunter - <i>Life</i><br>
</b><font size="2">vocal trance / electronic mix / Christian electronic<br>
4.5/5: decent album, his style changed a bit, much more emphasis on vocals. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Animusic - <i>Animusic<br>
</i></b><font size="2">percussive / new age<br>
4/5 &quot;Future Retro&quot; is a cool song. Think of it as synthesized Yanni.&nbsp; May 
come off as cheesy. The PBS program was cool though. <br>
<br>
</font>
<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Amon Tobin � <i>Bricolage </i>(1997)</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
�Electronic Jazz�/ Intelligent Dance Music / Ambient Dub </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
4.9/5 It was hard to choose between �Bricolage�, �Supermodified�, and �Out from 
No Where�, three great albums by Tobin. Supermodified is my originally my 
favorite, and is more popular then his earlier works. It was a very successful 
album, and contains some very remarkable sounds, no doubt. The same can be said 
for &quot;Out from No Where&quot;, which is a further development&nbsp; of his style. However, 
Bricolage&nbsp; wins high points of originality and influence. A lot of movie 
soundtracks have a similar sound. Additionally, &quot;Bricolage&quot; has started to grow 
on me, and every time I hear it I like it more and more. It is smooth electronic 
jazz at its finest. His later works are more rough and complex, by comparison. 
This, by contrast, is more sublime and beautiful.&nbsp; I also recommend the other 
two aforementioned albums as a continued evolution of this music.
</span></p>

</span>
</i></b><font size="2">Techno / drillcore </font>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
4.6 / 5 This is a historically important album, I suppose. It's a mixed bag, 
sophisticated techno mixed with acid-infused drillcore, Aphex Twin's own 
post-modern techno experience. It's definitely unique and a lot of his further 
explorations built off this burst of creativity. It blows always the stereotype 
that techno is monotonous</span><font size="2"> -- it is hard to find more 
dynamic music. It's no wonder the call him the &quot;Mozart of Techno&quot;.</font><b><i><br>

4.8/ 5 Many people call this Aphex Twin's opus magnum. Gets better with each 
listen. The first tracks in particular are pretty famous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Aphex Twin<i> - Selected Ambient Works Volume II <br>
<br>
</i>Aphex Twin - <i>The Richard D. James Album</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:9.0pt">Drillcore / IDM<br>
4.5/5 This is a hard style of techno almost completely invented from scratch by 
Aphex Twin. Its been taking me a while to actually enjoy this music fully.

<span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
3.8/5 I don't remember much about this. It has more experimentation, and he even 
does some non-electronic compositions for piano which are ok, but not 
classical-music grade or anything. </span><b><i><br>

3/5 They have about 2 good songs, the rest is repetitive drivel. <br>
<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF"><br>
</span></font><b><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">Billy Idol - </span><i>
<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">Cyberpunk</span><br>
</i></b><font size="2">Synthpop / 80s / electronic rock<br>
4/5 : I really wish I could say this album was good, because I love the concept. 
It's a concept album that didn't quite live up to what it could have been. It 
was radical and hated when it came out. It's very dystopian and typifies the 
dark side of the 80s. It got horrible, horrible reviews across the board. (1/10 
stars , AllMusicGuide gave it 1/5) and is still thought of as a flop. As bad as 
it is, I think some of the songs are worth a listen. The song &quot;Wasteland&quot; is a 
semi-decent song, but incredibly cheesy and riffy. &quot;Heroin&quot;, the remix of the 
famous Velvet Underground song, was called the worst remix of all time. It's so 
bad, it's good. Kindof like a B-movie music, I guess. The song &quot;Neuromancer&quot; is 
a cool concept song (the entire album was inspired by Neuromancer and related 
Gibson works.)&nbsp; Overall, some of the songs are painful to listen to, but as 
bad as it, I find myself enjoying some of the songs because the concept and 
because it distills the cheesy parts of the 80's. <br>

</span>
<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Brian Eno - <i>Ambient 1: Music For Airports </i>(1978)</span></b><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Ambient</span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">5/5 : This is one of the undisputed greats in 
electronic music. For me this is like meditation music, especially the first 
track. In fact, it was meant to be relaxing music for people waiting at 
airports. It scores high points on originality and influence. It earned Eno a 
respectable place in the history of western music.</span> <br>
<br>
<b>Bruce Haack - <i>Electric Lucifer <br>
</i></b><font size="2">Acid / Electro / Early hippie electronic music<br>
4.5/5 : Scores high on unusuality <br>
<br>
</font><b>Camarata Contemporary - <i>The Electric Spirit of Erik Satie</i> 
(1972)<br>
</b><font size="2">Minimalism / Symphonic / Advante Garde<br>
4/5 : A very rare album. Great concept but mediocre execution. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Cascada - <i>The Remix Album<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Eurotrash / Europop / Anthem <br>
4.3/5 : Very seductive eurotrash. A guilty pleasure. Technically there is 
nothing new here but there is some interesting synthesizer frequency modulation. 
Her tracks are made with a cookie cutter, they follow the simple build up, 
breakdown anthem formula which dominates eurotrash to this day. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Chicane - <i>The Best of Chicane (2009)<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Pure Ibiza trance<br>
4.1/5 : Not sure if I actually listened all the way through. The epic track here 
is &quot;Saltwater&quot;.<br>
<br>
</font><b>CPU Bach - <i>CPU Bach<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Synthesizer </font><b><i><br>
</i></b><font size="2"><i>4.5/5 : </i>Similar to the famous album by Wendy 
Carlos.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Crazy Frog - <i>Crazy Hits<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Eurotrash </font><b><i><br>
</i></b><font size="2"><i>0/5 : </i>I guess this is something you listen to for 
the agony. It's Euro-trash at it's worst. Not a guilty pleasure, just crap.<i><br>

5/5 :Arguably the <i>first </i>techno album ever produced, and one of the 
greatest. Highly recommended<i> </i>if you can find it.</span> <font size="2">

<br>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Techno <br>

Daft Punk - <i>Alive </i>(2007)<br>
<br>
Darude : <i>Calm Before the Storm</i></b><br>
<font size="2">Stadium House / Rave <br>
4.5/5:
This scores high points on popularity and a few on influence.
Most of the songs arn't very good, but a few like &quot;I can feel the beat&quot;
and &quot;Sandstorm&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="background-color: #FF9933"><br>
</span></font><b><span style="background-color: #FF9933">DJ Shadow - <i>Endtroducing.. </i>(1996)</span></b><span style="background-color: #FF9933">
</span> <br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Abstract hip-hop<br>
5/5 : <i>Endtroducing </i>is important because it was the first albums ever 
composed entirely of sound samples. At first this didn't seem like anything 
spectacular, but on my second listen I had acquired more taste for it. It is 
very postmodern, meaning that it incorporates old material in new ways. As DJ 
Shadow says this himself in one of the few lyrics : &quot;the music is flowing 
through me&quot;, ie. he is interpreting the music in his own way and presenting it 
in a novel fashion. It has several very sublime songs make for great chill out 
music.</span> <br>
<br>
<b>DJ Shadow - <i>Preemptive Strike </i>(1997)</b> <br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Abstract hip-hop<br>
3/5 - Bleh, somehow I don't remember it being that great at all.. Perhaps too 
&quot;abstract&quot;.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Faust � <i>Faust (</i>1971)</span><br>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Krautrock/Musique-concrete</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
4.9/5 This album is strange, horrible madness. As Darktremor says, it sounds 
like a journey through Hell. But it is never at one moment boring, instead it is 
&quot;morbidly&quot; captivating. Obviously the sounds here where influenced by the 
innovator Stockhausen, one of the great figures of Electronic Art Music. Yet I 
can't include any of Stockhausen works in this list, because, although he drove 
for large changes in music, he never had any truly stand-out albums that took 
even semi-popular appeal outside his tight circle of advante-garde friends, and 
he is more associated with classic music. This album is different, it takes 
Stockhausen's ideas and runs with them, and directly inspired many electronic 
musicians. This album was at the forefront of a deconstuctavist movement to 
totally demolish popular rock. In brief, this is truly a mind expanding album. 
It paved the way for the entire genre of industrial rock and a variety of German 
abstract rock called &quot;Krautrock&quot;. The Krautrock movement influenced Radiohead 
and other bands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr">
<b>Klaus Schulze - <i>Irrlicht</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Electronic Space Music/krautrock</span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">4/5 :Highly recommended for the curious! 
Personally, I couldn't make it <br>
all the way through this, but it was very very interesting.<br>
<br>
</span>


<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Kraftwerk � <i>Autobahn </i>(1974)</span><br>


</b><font size="2">Early techno / electro<br>
4.9/5: This receives such a high ranking for originality. It is one of the first 
albums to use synthesizers to create catchy melodies and other interesting sound 
effects, meant to convey a trip on the Autobahn. Previously electronic music had 
been mostly abstract experimentation in highly academic circles. Due to their 
overall influence on the development of electronic music, I could not leave Kraftwerk out of the top 10. A lot of people say �Trans-Europe Express� was 
their opus magnum, and I have listened to it, and perhaps it is true. Either 
way, it scores lower points on originality and influence. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Kraftwerk � <i>Electric Cafe<br>

</i>
</b><font size="2">Electro<br>
4/5 Decent album in the Kraftwerk style.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Kraftwerk � <i>Trans-Europe Express </i>(1977)<i><br>
</i>
</b><font size="2">Electro<br>
3.8/5 - Some claim it's their best, I just don't see it.<br>
<br>
</font><b>Kraftwerk � <i>The Man Machine </i>(1978)<i><br>
</i>
</b><font size="2">Electro<br>
4/5 Decent album, contains &quot;We are the Robots&quot;.<br>
<br>
</font><i><b>Illegal Rave vol. 1</b></i><font size="2"><br>
Hardcore rave / speedcore<br>
2/5 This is a nice album to have in your collection. Could really annoy your 
friends with this crap. <br>
</font><span style="background-color: #FF9933"><br>
</span><b><span style="background-color: #FF9933">Infected Mushroom - </span><i>
<span style="background-color: #FF9933">Classical Mushroom</span><font size="2"><br>
</font></i></b><font size="2">Dark Psy-trance / symphonic psy-tranc<br>
5/5 This is the best psy-trance album ever. Period. Partly because it's 
accessable to non- psytrance freaks (like me) and because it incorporates 
electric guitar and symphonic themes. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Infected Mushroom - <i>Cities of the Future<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Psy-trance<br>
3.5/5 A famous album by them, but not my cup of tea. It's a bit too over the 
top, too spazzy, not enough structure. Don't like the vocals very much either.
<br>
<br>
</font><b>Infected Mushroom - <i>Vicious Delicious </i>(2007)<i><font size="2"><br>
</font></i></b><font size="2">Psy-trance <br>
4.3/5 : I couldn't really get into a lot of the songs, but &quot;Heavy Weight&quot; is an 
AMAZING song. Totally insane electric guitar solo. Fucking crazy. <br>
<br>
</font><b>Isao Tomita - <i>Greatest Hits<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Synthesizer<br>
4.5/5 The greatest classical remixer. Remember that epic &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; from 
Oceans's 11? That's what this is.<i><br>
</i></font><br>
<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">James Holden <i>- Balance 005 </i>
(2003)</span><br>
</b><font size="2">Progressive House / Melodic house<br>
4.9/5 this it the greatest prog-house album I know. A bit long and tedious at 
times, but still quite amazing. Excellent cultural experience. Superb control.<br>
<br>
</font>
<b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">La Roux - <i>La Roux </i>(2009)</span><i><br>
</i></b><font size="2">Synthpop<br>
4.8/5 This is great as far as pop goes, borrows some from the 80s. I really like 
her style. </font><br>
<br>
<b>Ladytron - <i>604<br>

<br>
</font>
<b>The KLF - <i>The White Room</i></b><br>
<font size="2">Stadium House / Anthem House<br>
4.25/5 This is considered their Magnum Opus and the album that started Stadium House. 
Whether it is actually a masterwork 
is debatable.&nbsp; However, it does remain fresh after all these years. I 
really enjoyed it the first few listens, but I guess I got tired of it. <br>
<br>
</font>
<b>The KLF - <i>Chill Out </i>(1990)</b><br>
<font size="2">Ambient<br>
2.5/5 Some people claim this is a masterwork, but I couldn't get into it. Its kindof druggy, advante-garde, found it hard to associate with it. 
It's kindof for people that are really into British house and the whole &quot;KLF 
cult&quot;.<br>
<br>
</font>
<b><span style="background-color: #FF9933">Massive Attack - <i>Blue Lines </i>(1991)</span><br>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Trip-hop<br>
5/5 : </span><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Blue Lines</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt"> 
is considered the first album of the British &quot;Trip-hop&quot; style. Its smooth, 
down-tempo, house-y, basically hip hop with a lot of style. Also has some 
elements from reggae. <br>

mediocre. <br>

4.8/5 This is a very unique early electronic album. Well known amongst 
post-modern musical circles, but hard to find. <br>
<br>
</span><b>Nalin and Kane - <i>Beachball (remixes)<span style="font-size:10.0pt"><br>
</span></i></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Ibiza / Balearic Beat<br>
3.8/5 : A seminal work in Ibiza trance, but somehow it doesn't quite stand out 
any more.</span><b><i><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><br>
<br>
Night at the Roxbury Soundtrack</span><br>
</i></b><font size="2">Europop / Eurotrash<br>
4.8 / 5 : This entire album is guilty pleasures -- it's the ultimate condensed europop 
anthology. <br>
<br>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt">Psychedelic Trance <br>
4.9/5
This is a really cool album: a mixture of classical and psychedelic trance 
styles. It is by far the best Psychedelic trance album I have heard, probably 
because it has a reference points in classical music and rock. Highly 
recommended, but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea. </span></p>
<p><b>Paragliders (Oliver Lieb) - <i>The Oasis EP<br>
</i></b><font size="2">Progressive trance / classic trance<br>
4.5/5 -- More genius from Oliver Lieb. Somewhat of an acquired taste. Basically a 
single track / some side tracks. Very German, very unpredictable beats, very 
classic. Similar in style and spirit to<i> </i>&quot;A Day on Our Planet&quot;.<i> </i>Can 
get tiring though.</font><b><br>
<br>
Pink Floyd - <i>The Wall</i></b><br>

4/5 : A very popular album, and a good introduction to the sounds of hit

5/5 This is my favorite mix album (granted I have not listened to <i>that </i>
many, so this may be biased), but it considered by darktremor as one of greatest 
of all time, among a few others DJs. The original version was a double album, 
which contains two CDs, North and South, which was only released in Europe. I 
believe they were released separately in the United States. &quot;North&quot; is more well 
known, and in my opinion, the better part as well. ( it contains amazing songs 
by major artists such as The Orb, William Orbit, Banco de Gaia and Apollo 440). 
I have also heard much high praise for another Sasha and Digweed production 
called &quot;Renaissance: the Mix Collection&quot;. Apparently, it one of the Opus Magnums 
of ambient house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have listened to some or it, but have not been able to get 
a full copy (which is pathetic, I know). Sasha &amp; Digweed also produced the opus 
magnum of progressive house : <i>Renaissance : The Mix Collection</i> : a 3 CD 
collection which is an impressive mix of progressive house at its finest. It is 
highly recommended if you have never listened to progressive house before.<b><i><br>

5/5&nbsp;As online electronic music expert Darktremor says, &quot;The first wave of 
trance was perfected here ... Sci-fi samples, long ambient washes, an unqeildy 
length to the tracks, laser twerps, catchy melodies, unpredictable structure, 
and acid, acid, acid. However, A Day on Our Planet really transcends all that, 
to be something far greater, something far more beautiful. Lieb (as in OLIVER 
LIEB, &gt; noob) has tapped into some otherworldy, alien atmosphere with the 4 
tracks contained here, he's managed to produce something not of the Earth. There 
is no rave reference point to this trance (something that really can't be said 
for most other trance...): the beats are momentum (and you couldn't dance to a 
lot of this anyway), this album is a fast-moving journey through another 
universe.&quot; This scores low on popularity, but is representative of the influence 
of Oliver Lieb in a wider sense upon the development of trance and EDM. It may 
be the most biased ranking here, as it is a very obscure album. <br>

greatest ambient tracks ever made. This music is meant to be played in &quot;chillout

acclaim over the years, due to the use of experimental ambient sampling and 
music concrete tempered with some pop sensibility. . Some songs are somber and

</b>5/5 <b>&nbsp;:</b> Highly recommended!!! This is 
what I usually recommend as a first trance album. It is my favorite, and I have 
listened to it at least 25 times, if not more. There is nothing particularly 
special about the mixing. The real genius of Tiesto comes from the track listing 
and selection. This is an album which&nbsp; takes you on an aural journey: a journey 
which perfectly captures all the wonderful sounds of commercial &quot;epic&quot; trance. 
The album is generally described as smooth, uplifting, sensual, a tad 
spooky/nocturnal, and just plain uber-cool. The tracks are basically hit after 
hit after hit by the best artists in commercial uplifting trance. The track 
selection is done to insure lots of tension and release, both in the 
macrostructure of the album and the internal emotional power of the tracks. 
Songs include &quot;Walhalla&quot;, &quot;Far From Over&quot;, &quot;Sparkles (Magikal remix)&quot; composed 
by Tiesto himself (under different aliases), and others by big names in the 
genre like Yahel Sherman, Lange, BT, and Billie Ray Martin.</span></p>

: Great album of classic hard trance which never gets old. Newbies might have a

skill and precision. This is not your head banging rave album: here we have 
rich, complex, unpredictable beat structure, with lots of �classic trance� bells 
and whistles, like laser chirps, acid bass lines, arpegiators, etc. This could 
be thought of as �Intelligent dance music�� although towards the end the BPM 
goes up a bit and it gets a bit rave-esque, and the wonderful consistency that 
characterized the first half is broken. I find I can only listen to half this

3.25/5 I was non-plussed. It's too commercial, its struggling to be new but 
isn't. He's trying to satiate more western audiences and people the teeming 
masses. The song &quot;Louder than bomb&quot; was pretty cool though, great synthesizer 
control, I like the &quot;8-bit&quot; sound that seems to be popular now, but I wouldn't 
call it a masterpiece. This album seems to have been mostly criticized by trance 
critics. Trancecritic.com gave it 1/5 stars an a horrible review, AllMusicGuide 
gave it 3.5/5. The biggest complaint is that for people who have listened to 
trance for a long time and Tiesto's previous albums, this music is pretty 
boring, it's the kindof music that people who go to clubs for sex will enjoy. 
People that go to clubs for the music will hate it. Also, the track list is a 
bit over-stuffed. That said, I felt &quot;You Are My Diamond&quot; was a well-executed, 
albeit incredibly generic europop song. A year ago I would never have guessed it 
was composed by Tiesto. <br>

I listened to the 2000 CD featured in a 7 CD collection released that year. 
There is also a 2012 �reissue� which I assume is pretty close to the original 
1974 release. The first four tracks of this album (�Platinum parts 1-4�) are the 
highest pinnacle of achievement in the field of elevator / call waiting music. I 
feel as though that there are not many albums like this out there. The song 
�Punkaddidle� is a nice amusing tune on the second half. </span><br>

While perhaps not technically not electronica, I feel that this album involved 
enough post production and mixing to warrant mention here. This is one of the 
great albums of the 20th century. I�m not exactly sure what to say about it, but 
it is filled with beautiful contemporary times. It also has some nice structured 
build ups which are similiar to things found in the minimalist movement, but 
designed to have more popular appeal. I love voice over narration towards the 
end of �Part 1� -- I suppose it could be considered a type of �metamusic� -- 
music about music. </span><br>

Fun mix album. The first 4-5 tracks in particular are superbly mixed, with some 
of the best transitions I�ve ever heard. However, after about half way through 
(~35min) the album�s 80s eurodisco sound becomes somewhat tiring. The second 
half of the album is nothing remarkable. I highly recommend the first half, 
though. </span><br>

There isn�t anything fundamentally new here, but the production quality is very 
high. Her DJ should get more attention, but my suspicion is that the record 
company is keeping him under the radar so as not to detract from Gaga�s image as 
the new pop superstar. The music here is fundamentally basically a mixture of 
the same types of pop we heard in the early 2000�s from Britney Spears et. al. 
repackaged with some dark frills. She borrowed lyrically and stylistically from 
Madonna but has made her fashion style sufficiently �crazy� enough so as not to 
be considered a complete knock-off of her. She has also tried to remake herself 
as a talented �cabaret� artist, and to that regard I think she has failed 
miserably. I�m not sure if she (or more accurately, her production artists) use 
auto tuning and really don�t care either way - she is a talented vocalist to the 
extent required of her to achieve her popular success, and the use autotuning, 
if anything only adds to the already high production value of these tracks. 
Madonna and a lot of other big pop stars used or continue to use backup singers 
to make their music sound better, so what�s wrong with artists using auto-tuning 
to do the same? &nbsp;These albums have some songs which are very good, such as 
�Poker Face�, �Alejandro� and �The Edge of Glory�, but also contain an equal or 
larger number of songs which I consider utterly tasteless and bland such as 
�Monster�, �Dance in the Dark�, �Hair�, �Teeth� and �Heavy metal lover�. At the 
risk of hyperbole I believe �Poker Face� to be one of the top pop songs of all 
time, with it�s addictive hook, throbbing 80s hoovers, sleek production value 
and quirky lyrics. I guess the thing which I personally like about her music is 
the use of darker hoover-esque sounds and a strong baseline balanced and 
contrasted with her fruity feminine vocals, but that�s just what is whetting my 
appetite in electronic music at the moment and those elements can be found in 
many albums coming out in the 2010s. &nbsp;</span><br>

This album is very good. They definitely achieved something new here, creating a 
fusion of what I would call �progressive microhouse� with �synthpop�. &nbsp;I find 
the designation of �post dubstep� questionable, as there are not really any real 
dubstep drops here, but there are a few spazzy dubstep �mini-drops�. The drum 
tracks are �duby� but not �dubsteppy�, in my opinion. Also, considering that 
dubstep is a relatively new and undeveloped genre, the designation of �post 
dubstep� seems premature to me. The term �post-___� is usually used to refer to 
a reaction to a genre after it�s full development has more or less finished (is, 
post-rock, post-modernism, post-cyberpunk), whereas here it seems to be 
referring more to a development of a genre or perhaps just a mixture of this 
genre with others. &nbsp;Perhaps a better term would be �progressive dubstep�. The 
sheer number of different genres by which this music has been labeled testify to 
its greatness. </span><br>

This album is pretty much just as good as �Gossamer�, but I listened to 
�Gossamer� first, so I seem to be slightly biased towards that one. Some tracks 
are more traditional prog. rock and other tracks (such as �Sleepyhead�) are 
delightfully quirky electronica. </span><br>

Originally a purely metal band, in 2000 they completely changed their style to a 
mainly electronic format with their release of �Musique�. This was very 
disappointing to their fans, but personally I find this album to be superior to 
their previous works. This album is oozing with transhuman / sci fi themes. I 
also especially like the song �Radio�, because of the addictive hook, and 
lyrical content of the song �Commute� which is about commuting. This is 
definitely by far the best album I�ve found in the somewhat limited �electronic 
metal� genre. The contrast between male and female vocals, a mainstay of the 
metal genre, is very well done in some of the tracks here, with the male vocal 
serving as the �robot� and the female vocal serve as the �futuristic electronic 
lover�. </span><br>

I particularly like the delicious hook in �Automatic Lover�. As far as the rest 
of the album, it isn�t as good as the first song or as �Assembly�, but if I 
recall correctly, is still great electronic metal. </span><br>
