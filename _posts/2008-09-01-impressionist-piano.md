<p>Criteria: personal taste / experience, popularity, originality. </p>
<br>
<p><b>What is impressionism? </b><br>
Impressionism was a movement in classical music which occurred 
during the transition from romanticism to modernism. It was in part a reaction 
to the intense, drawn-out pieces of the romantic era. It was also a period of 
heavy experimentation with minor keys and dissonance. Impressionist pieces are 
relatively short, and usually are meant to represent a specific scene (such as 
&quot;the old castle&quot;, &quot;the swan&quot;, &quot;the tempest&quot;, etc). <br>
<br>
<b>1. Children's Corner<br>
</b>by Claude Debussy<br>
Children's Corner is my favorite album of impressionist music. It perfectly 
conveys the simple joys and amusements of childhood. All of the pieces have 
interesting uses of dissonance, diminished chords, and whimsical ornamentation. 
The most famous is probably &quot;Golliwog's Cakewalk&quot;, which is commonly 
heard at 
piano recitals. The first piece, &quot;Doctor Gradus ad Parrssanum&quot; is also&nbsp;aimed at poking fun at Gradus ad Parrssanum, the textbook on classical 
counterpoint. <br>
<br>
<b>2. Pictures at an Exhibition (1874)<br>
</b>by Mussorgsky, later orchestrated by Maurice Ravel and others<br>
Pictures at an exhibition is a textbook example of impressionism. It is based on 
a Russian art exhibit given during Mussorgsky's time. It consists of ten pieces, 
and has a unique semi rondo type form, since it (randomly) alternates between a 
main theme, &quot;The Promenade&quot;, and the pictures. The promenade is supposed to 
represent strolling through the art gallery. The Old Castle is my favorite 
piece, and probably the most well known. It is also one of the most relaxing 
pieces of piano music ever made. Other movements are, The Gnome, A Polish cart 
on enormous wheels, drawn by oxen<span xml:lang="ru">, </span>
<span xml:lang="ru" lang="ru">Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks</span><span xml:lang="ru">,
</span>Two Jews: Rich and Poor, French women quarreling violently in the market,<i>
</i>The Catacombs, etc. <br>
<br>
<b>3. Bergamasque Suite<br>
</b>by Claude Deubssy <br>
Contains the famous &quot;Claire de Lune&quot; (&quot;moonlight&quot;). <br>
<br>
<b>4. Six Gnossiennes<br>
</b>by Erik Satie <br>
<b><br>
5. Trois Morceaux En Forme de Poire (&quot;Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear&quot;)<br>
</b>by Erik Satie <br>
Pure Satie. One of his most original works. </p>
<p><b>6. Trois Gymnopedies <br>
</b>by Erik Satie, later orchestrated by Debussy<br>
Marked to be played as &quot;Lent et Trieste&quot;, (slow and sad), Satie's most popular 
work. Also a contender for most relaxing piano music of all time. </p>
<p><b>7. Preludes <br>
</b>by Claude Debussy <br>
Contains &quot;Dance of the Dolphins&quot; and some more abstract dissonant works.
<br>
<br>
<b>8. La Mer (Three Symphonic Sketches)<br>
</b>by Claude Debussy<br>
&quot;The Sea&quot; for piano and orchestra</p>
<p><b>9. Carnival of the Animals (The Zoological Fantasy) <br>
</b>by Camille Saint-Saëns<br>
Carnival of the animals is a collection of delightfully short pieces for piano 
and orchestra. Probably the most famous song is &quot;The Swan&quot;. &quot;The Swan&quot; captures 
the grace and relaxed composure of swans. The Aquarium piece is also very cool. 
Jokingly, there is also a piece called the &quot;The Pianist&quot;. <br>
<br>
<b>10. Furniture Music <br>
</b>by Erik Satie<br>
This is Satie's experimental background music for orchestra. It is not 
particularly great sounding but is important because it is essentially 
minimalism decades before its time. I have it ripped from vinyl if anyone is 
interested. I also have very rare electronic renditions.&nbsp; <br>

<p><b>Quotes by Eric Satie: </b><font size="3"><b><img border="0" src="www.moreisdifferent.com/assets/pictures/satie.jpg" width="344" height="697" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="6"></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>&quot;What I am&quot;</b><br>
Everyone will tell you I am not a musician. That is correct.<br>
From the very beginning of my career I class myself a phonometrographer. My work 
is completely phonometrical. Take my <em>Fils des Étoiles</em>, or my <em>
Morceaux en forme de Poire</em>, my <em>En habit de Cheval</em> or my <em>
Sarabandes</em> - it is evident that musical ideas played no part whatsoever in 
their composition. Science is the dominating factor.<br>
Besides, I enjoy measuring a sound much more than hearing it. With my phonometer 
in my hand, I work happily and with confidence.<br>
What haven't I weighed or measured? I've done all Beethoven, all Verdi, etc. 
It's fascinating.<br>
The first time I used a phonoscope, I examined a B flat of medium size. I can 
assure you that I have never seen anything so revolting. I called in my man to 
show it to him.<br>
On my phono-scales a common or garden F sharp registered 93 kilos. It came out 
of a fat tenor whom I also weighed.<br>
Do you know how to clean sounds? It's a filthy business. Stretching them out is 
cleaner; indexing them is a meticulous task and needs good eyesight. Here, we 
are in the realm of pyrophony.<br>
To write my <em>Pièces Froides</em>, I used a caleidophone recorder. It took 
seven minutes. I called in my man to let him hear them.<br>
I think I can say that phonology is superior to music. There's more variety in 
it. The financial return is greater, too. I owe my fortune to it.<br>
At all events, with a motodynamophone, even a rather inexperienced 
phonometrologist can easily note down more sounds that the most skilled musician 
in the same time, using the same amount of effort. This is how I have been able 
to write so much.<br>
And so the future lies with philophony.<br>

<p><font size="3">Note: Erik (sometimes spelled &quot;Eric&quot;) Satie was an eclectic musician who was a 
contemporary of Debussy. He was rejected in his own time, and lived a bohemian 
life; however by influencing Debussy,<i> </i>John Cage,<i> </i>and others he is 
certainly one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, even though 
he </font>rarely gets much credit for it. <br>
