## Philosophy

>"We are creatures of matter. And we should learn to live with that fact." - Paul M. Churchland

>"The reductionist worldview is chilling and impersonal. It has to be accepted as it is, not because we like it, but because that is the way the world works." - Steven Weinberg

>"The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy. – Steven Weinberg

>"Yes, we have a soul. But it’s made of lots of tiny robots." — Giulio Giorelli  

## Life

>"Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them." - Marcus Aurelius

>"A balance that does not tremble cannot weigh. A man who does not tremble cannot live. " – Erwin Chargaff

>"Try to learn something about everything, and everything about something." – T. H. Huxley

>"I believe that it is better to tell the truth than to lie. I believe that it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe that it is better to know than be ignorant." – H. L. Mencken

>"For every problem, there is one solution which is simple, neat and wrong." – H. L. Mencken

>"Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

>"In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on." -Robert Frost

>"In the depths of winter I finally learned there was in me an invincible summer." - Albert Camus

>"Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be." - Abraham Lincoln

>"Did you ever see an unhappy horse? Did you ever see bird that had the blues? One reason why birds and horses are not unhappy is because they are not trying to impress other birds and horses." - Dale Carnegie

>"Don’t walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don’t walk behind me, I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend." – Albert Camus

>"In the depth of winter I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer." – Albert Camus

>"Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention." – Francis Bacon

>"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence." – Albert Einstein

>"There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them!" - Richard P. Feynman (written in the 1950s (!))

## Politics
>"Every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under." – H.L. Mencken

>"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." - Lord Action

>"The socialists believe in two things which are absolutely different and perhaps even contradictory: freedom and organization." - Elie Halevy

>"The notion that a radical is one who hates his country is naive and usually idiotic. He is, more likely, one who loves his country more than the rest of us, and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees it debauched. He is not a bad citizen turning to crime; he is a good citizen driven to despair." – H. L. Mencken

>"Men become civilized not in proportion to their willingness to believe but in proportion to their readiness to doubt." – H. L. Mencken

>"When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion." – C. P. Snow

>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man" - George Bernard Shaw, *Maxims for Revolutionists*

>"He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him a spinal cord would fully suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action. It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder." – Albert Einstein

>"Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can only be attained through understanding." – Albert Einstein

>"Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all." – Frederic Bastiat

>"Recent studies in the sociology of law once more confirm that the fundamental principle of formal law by which every case must be judged according to general rational precepts, which have as few exceptions as possible and are based on logical subsumptions, obtains only for the liberal competitive phase of capitalism." Karl Mannheim


## Liberty
>"Many liberals, including Berlin, have suggested that the positive concept of liberty carries with it a danger of authoritarianism." - *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*

>"Liberty consists in doing what one desires." – John Stuart Mill, in *On Liberty* (1859)

>"Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add ‘within the limits of the law’, because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual." - Thomas Jefferson

>"Liberty describes the absence of a particular obstacle — coercion by other men … the range of physical possibilities from which a person can choose at a given moment has no direct relevance to freedom.” - F. A Hayek

>"Freedom, in a political context, has only one meaning: the absence of physical coercion."" - Ayn Rand

>"Only freedom has compassion." - Ron Paul

>"There are many paths to libertarianism. Many reasons for becoming a libertarian. Ethical: Embracing the "Non-Aggression Principle". Opposition to the use of force. Pragmatic: Freedom works. Freedom is practical and effective and efficient. Utilitarian: Freedom provides the greatest good for the greatest number. Egoistic: Freedom benefits you. Freedom is in your self-interest. Altruistic: Freedom benefits others. Freedom is in their interest. Outcome: Freedom produces results that you want. It maximizes individual choice. Freedom promotes and rewards personal responsibility. Freedom creates prosperity." – Michael Cloud

>"Laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system based on the recognition of individual rights and, therefore, the only system that bans force from social relationships. By the nature of its basic principles and interests, it is the only system fundamentally opposed to war." - Ayn Rand

>"I prefer liberty with danger than peace with slavery” - Jean-Jacques Rousseau

>"Liberty is always dangerous, but it is the safest thing we have." – Harry Emerson Fosdick

>“Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.” - George Barnard Shaw

>"If you are not free to choose wrongly and irresponsibly, you are not free at all." – Jacob Hornberger (1995)

>"Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing himself." – Leo Tolstoy

>"We maybe free and yet miserable. To be free may mean freedom to starve, to make costly mistakes, or to run mortal risks." - F.A. Hayek

>“Liberty has never come from Government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of it... The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it.” - Woodrow Wilson

>“All government, of course, is against liberty.” - H.L. Mencken

>“If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” - George Orwell

>"The liberty of speaking and writing guards our other liberties." - Thomas Jefferson

>"Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom." – Albert Einstein

>"There must be no barriers to freedom of inquiry. There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors. Our political life is also predicated on openness. We know that the only way to avoid error is to detect it and that the only way to detect it is to be free to inquire. And we know that as long as we are free to ask what we must, free to say what we think, free to think what we will, freedom can never be lost, and science can never regress." - J. Robert Oppenheimer

>"Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master." – George Washington

>"In a country where the sole employer is the State, opposition means death by slow starvation. The old principle: who does not work shall not eat, has been replaces by a new one: who does not obey shall not eat." - Leon Trotsky (1937)

>"Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations; entangling alliances with none." – Thomas Jefferson

>"A government which robs Peter to pay Paul, can always count on the support of Paul." – George Bernard Shaw

>"The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigor, and moral courage it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time." - John Stuart Mill, in *On Liberty*

>"When goods don't cross borders, soldiers will." – Fredric Bastiat, early French economist

>"From the fact that people are very different it follows that, if we treat them equally, the result must be inequality in their actual position, and the only way to place them in an equal position would be to treat them differently. Equality before the law and material equality are therefore not only different but are in conflict with each other; and we can achieve either the one or the other, but not both at the same time." – Friedrich von Hayek

>"There is all the difference in the world between treating people equally and attempting to make them equal."" – F.A. Hayek

>"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety" - Benjamin Franklin

>"Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice: all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things." - Adam Smith

>“A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it ... gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.” ― Milton Friedman

>"...where dreams alone are blueprints, nightmares result." -T. Dalrymple

>"If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter." - George Washington, March 15, 1783

## Human nature
>"If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the dividing line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being, and who is willing to destroy his own heart?" – Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

>"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the “Universe", a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest – a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." – Albert Einstein

>"You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for our own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful." – Marie Curie

## Inspiration

>"Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy." - Guillaume Appollinaire

>"It is possible to believe that all the past is but the beginning of a beginning, and that all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn. It is possible to believe that all the human mind has ever accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.” ― H.G. Wells

>"It is the stillest words that bring on the storm. Thoughts that come on doves' feet guide the world." - Friedrich Nietzsche

>"To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself." - Soren Kierkegaard

>"Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend." - Albert Camus

## Science

>"I don't know anything, but I do know that everything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough." - Richard P. Feynman

>"Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard P. Feynman

>"If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."
– Albert Einstein

>"It seems to me that Keats was wrong when he asked, rhetorically, “Do not all charms fly…at the mere touch of cold philosophy?” The word “philosophy” standing, in his day, for what we now call “physical science.” But Keats was wrong, I say, because there is more charm in one “mere” fact, confirmed by test and observation, linked to other facts through coherent theory into a rational system, than in a whole brainful of fancy and fantasy. I see more poetry in a chunk of quartzite than in a make-believe wood nymph, more beauty in the revelations of a verifiable intellectual construction than in whole misty empires of obsolete mythology...Any good poet, in our age at least, must begin with the scientific view of the world; and any scientist worth listening to must be something of a poet, must possess the ability to communicate to the rest of us his sense of love and wonder at what his work discovers." – Edward Abbey

>"It is the sense of mystery that, in my opinion, drives the true scientist; the same blind force, blindly seeing, deafly hearing, unconsciously remembering, that drives the larva into the butterfly. If [the scientist] has not experienced, at least a few times in his life, this cold shudder down his spine, this confrontation with an immense invisible face whose breath moves him to tears, he is not a scientist." – Erwin Chargaff

>"I believe that scientific knowledge has fractal properties; that no matter how much we learn; whatever is left, however small it may seem, is just as infinitely complex as the whole was to start with. That, I think, is the secret of the Universe." – Isaac Asimov

>"There are many aspects of the universe that still can’t be explained satisfactorily by science; but ignorance implies only ignorance that may some day be conquered. To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature up to this time, and it remains premature today." – Isaac Asimov

>"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ (I found it!) but ‘That’s funny…’"– Isaac Asimov

>"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties." – Francis Bacon

>"Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed." – Francis Bacon

>"Let the mind be enlarged, according to its capacity, to the grandeur of the mysteries, and not the mysteries contracted to the narrowness of the mind." – Francis Bacon

>"Knowledge is power." – Francis Bacon

>"Physics is to math what sex is to masturbation." - Richard P. Feynman

>"You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don’t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we’re here…I don’t have to know an answer. I don’t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell. It doesn’t frighten me." – Richard P. Feynman

>"A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts – physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on – remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!" – Richard P. Feynman

>"Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars – mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is “mere.” I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination – stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern – of which I am a part – perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?" – Richard P. Feynman

>"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day." – Albert Einstein


>"One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike – and yet it is the most precious thing we have." – Albert Einstein

>"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." - Albert Einstein (referring to the death of a fellow physicist)


>"...all the sciences, and not just the sciences but all the efforts of intellectual kinds, are an endeavor to see the connections of the hierarchies, to connect beauty to history, to connect history to man’s psychology, man’s psychology to the working of the brain, the brain to the neural impulse, the neural impulse to the chemistry, and so forth, up and down, both ways. And today we cannot, and it is no use making believe that we can, draw carefully a line all the way from one end of this thing to the other, because we have only just begun to see that there is this relative hierarchy. And I do not think either end is nearer to God. To stand at either end, and to walk off that end of the pier only, hoping that out in that direction is the complete understanding, is a mistake. And to stand with evil and beauty and hope, or to stand with the fundamental laws, hoping that way to get a deep understanding of the whole world, with that aspect alone, is a mistake. It is not sensible for the ones who specialize at the other end, to have such disregard for each other. (They don’t actually, but people say they do.) The great mass of workers in between, connecting one step to another, are improving all the time our understanding of the world, both from working at the ends and working in the middle, and in that way we are gradually understanding this tremendous world of interconnecting hierarchies." – Richard P. Feynman (source unknown)


<!--
It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.
– Albert Einstein

 I believe in Spinoza’s God who reveals Himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.
– Albert Einstein

 From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist…It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere – childish analogies. We have to admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of this world – as far as we can grasp it. And that is all.
– Albert Einstein

Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.
– Albert Einstein

"How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...
"I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.
"My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a 'lone traveler' and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude..."

-from "The World as I See It", by Albert Einstein

My Credo (1932)

Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation…The road to this paradise was not as comforting and alluring as the road to the religious paradise; but it has proved itself as trustworthy, and I have never regretted having chosen it.
– Albert Einstein

The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.
– Albert Einstein

The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.
– Albert Einstein

<!-- Religion ------------------------------

I would defend the liberty of consenting adult creationists to practice whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.

– Arthur C. Clarke

Science can destroy a religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.

– Arthur C. Clarke

Science simply doesn’t deal with hypotheses about a guiding intelligence, or supernatural phenomena like miracles, because science is the search for rational explanations of natural phenomena. We don’t reject the supernatural merely because we have an overweening philosophical commitment to materialism; we reject it because entertaining the supernatural has never helped us understand the natural world. Alchemy, faith healing, astrology, creationism – none of these perspectives has advanced our understanding of nature by one iota....

Scientific “truths” are empirically supported observations agreed on by different observers. Religious “truths,” on the other hand, are personal, unverifiable and contested by those of different faiths.

– Jerry A. Coyne

The fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning of wisdom.

– Clarence Darrow

The modern world is the child of doubt and inquiry, as the ancient world was the child of fear and faith.

– Clarence Darrow

At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that Hindoos, Mahomadans and others might argue in the same manner and with equal force in favour of the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the Buddists of no God. There are also many barbarian tribes who cannot be said with any truth to believe in what we call God: they believe indeed in spirits or ghosts, and it can be explained, as Tyler and Herbert Spencer have shown, how such a belief would be likely to arise.

Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to, (although I do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed in me), to the firm conviction of the existence of God, and of the immortality of the soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, ‘it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind.’ I well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body. But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and feelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man who has become colour-blind, and the universal belief by men of the existence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the least value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God; but we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists. The state of mind which grand scenes formerly excited in me, and which was intimately connected with a belief in God, did not essentially differ from that which is often called the sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to explain the genesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for the existence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar feelings excited by music.

– Charles Darwin

 To invoke God as a blanket explanation of the unexplained is to make God the friend of ignorance. If God is to be found, it must surely be through what we discover about the world, not what we fail to discover.

– Paul Davies

In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won’t find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.

– Richard Dawkins


I think it’s important to realize that when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them. It is possible for one side to be simply wrong.

– Richard Dawkins


Science shares with religion the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not.

– Richard Dawkins


If you have a faith, it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had. No doubt soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving stories and parables, help a bit. But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the accident of birth. The convictions that you so passionately believe would have been a completely different, and largely contradictory, set of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a different place. Epidemiology, not evidence.

– Richard Dawkins

Mystery generates wonder, and wonder generates awe. The gasp can terrify or the gasp can emancipate. As I allow myself to experience cosmic and quantum Mystery, I join the saints and visionaries in their experience of what they called the Divine, and then I wander back 26 centuries to embrace Lao Tzu and the first chapter of the Tao Te Ching:


No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish.

– David Hume

There is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves

– David Hume

I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind – that its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have been more than overcome by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.
– H. L. Mencken

Religion is fundamentally opposed to everything I hold in veneration – courage, clear thinking, honesty, fairness, and above all, love of the truth.
– H. L. Mencken

There is, in fact, nothing about religious opinions that entitles them to any more respect than other opinions get. On the contrary, they tend to be noticeably silly.
– H. L. Mencken

"One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love." - Sophocles






<p align="left">

&quot;Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.&quot;<br>
--<a href="http://www.1-love-quotes.com/cgi-bin/viewquotes.cgi?action=search&Author_First_Name=&Author_Last_Name=Aristotle">Aristotle</a><br>
<br>
not sure why these are here, but here's a long rant by Ayn Rand: <br>
h<br>
I am referring here to romantic love, in the serious meaning of that term�as
distinguished from the superficial infatuations of those whose sense of life is
devoid of any consistent values, <i lang="la">i.e.</i>, of any lasting emotions
other than fear. Love is a response to values. It is with a person�s sense of
life that one falls in love�with that essential sum, that fundamental stand or
way of facing existence, which is the essence of a personality. One falls in
love with the embodiment of the values that formed a person�s character, which
are reflected in his widest goals or smallest gestures, which create the <em>
style</em> of his soul�the individual style of a unique, unrepeatable,
irreplaceable consciousness. It is one�s own sense of life that acts as the
selector, and responds to what it recognizes as one�s own basic values in the
person of another. It is not a matter of professed convictions (though these are
not irrelevant); it is a matter of much more profound, conscious <em>and
subconscious</em> harmony<br>
Many errors and tragic disillusionments are possible in this process of
emotional recognition, since a sense of life, by itself, is not a reliable
cognitive guide. And if there are degrees of evil, then one of the most evil
consequences of mysticism�in terms of human suffering�is the belief that love is
a matter of �the heart,� not the mind, that love is an emotion independent of
reason, that love is blind and impervious to the power of philosophy. Love is
<em>the expression of philosophy</em>�of a subconscious philosophical sum�and,
perhaps, no other aspect of human existence needs the <em>conscious</em> power
of philosophy quite so desperately. When that power is called upon to verify and
support an emotional appraisal, when love is a conscious integration of reason
and emotion, of mind and values, then�and only then�it is the greatest reward of
man�s life. -Ayn Rand <br>

<p>Let us answer the question: �Can you measure love?�
<p>The concept �love� is formed by isolating two or more instances of the
appropriate psychological process, then retaining its distinguishing
characteristics (an emotion proceeding from the evaluation of an existent as a
positive value and as a source of pleasure) and omitting the object and the
measurements of the process�s intensity.
<p>The object may be a thing, an event, an activity, a condition or a person.
The intensity varies according to one�s evaluation of the object, as, for
instance, in such cases as one�s love for ice cream, or for parties, or for
reading, or for freedom, or for the person one marries. The concept �love�
subsumes a vast range of values and, consequently, of intensity: it extends from
the lower levels (designated by the subcategory �liking�) to the higher level
(designated by the subcategory �affection,� which is applicable only in regard
to persons) to the highest level, which includes romantic love.
<p>If one wants to measure the intensity of a particular instance of love, one
does so by reference to the hierarchy of values of the person experiencing it. A
man may love a woman, yet may rate the neurotic satisfactions of sexual
promiscuity higher than her value to him. Another man may love a woman, but may
give her up, rating his fear of the disapproval of others (of his family, his
friends or any random strangers) higher than her value. Still another man may
risk his life to save the woman he loves, because all his other values would
lose meaning without her. The emotions in these examples are not emotions of the
same intensity or dimension. Do not let a James Taggart type of mystic tell you
that love is immeasurable.

""Science can destroy a religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever

� Arthur C. Clarke
Science simply doesn�t deal
with hypotheses about a guiding intelligence, or supernatural phenomena like
miracles, because science is the search for rational explanations of natural
phenomena. We don�t reject the supernatural merely because we have an
overweening philosophical commitment to materialism; we reject it because
<i style>entertaining the supernatural has never helped us understand the
natural world</i>. Alchemy, faith healing, astrology, <span class="GramE">
creationism � none of these perspectives has advanced our understanding
of nature by one iota....
Scientific �truths� are
empirically supported observations agreed on by different observers. Religious
�truths,� on the other hand, are personal, unverifiable and contested by those
of different faiths.

The fear of God is not the

At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an
intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are
experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that <span class="SpellE">
Hindoos, <span class="SpellE">Mahomadans and others might argue in
the same manner and with equal force in <span class="SpellE">favour of
the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the <span class="SpellE">
Buddists of no God. There are also many barbarian tribes who cannot be
said with any truth to believe in what we call God: they believe indeed in
spirits or ghosts, and it can be explained, as Tyler and Herbert Spencer have
shown, how such a belief would be likely to arise.
<span style>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to, (although
I do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed in me),
to the firm conviction of the existence of God, and of the immortality of the
soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of
a Brazilian forest, �it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher
feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind.� I
well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of
his body. But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and
feelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man who has
become <span class="SpellE">colour-blind, and the universal belief by men
of the existence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the least
value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races
had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God; but we know that
this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward
convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.
The state of mind which grand scenes formerly excited in me, and which was
intimately connected with a belief in God, did not essentially differ from that
which is often called the sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to
explain the genesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for
the existence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar
feelings excited by music.
� Charles Darwin
&nbsp;To invoke God as a blanket
explanation of the unexplained is to make God the friend of ignorance. If God is
to be found, it must surely be through what we discover about the world, not
what we fail to discover.
� Paul Davies
In a universe of electrons
and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people
are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won�t find
any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has
precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no
purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.
� Richard Dawkins
&nbsp;
I think it�s important to
realize that when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal
intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them. It
is possible for one side to be simply wrong.
� Richard Dawkins
&nbsp;
Science shares with religion
the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and
the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by
evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not.
� Richard Dawkins
&nbsp;
If you have a faith, it is
statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents
and grandparents had. No doubt soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving
stories and parables, help a bit. But by far the most important variable
determining your religion is the accident of birth. The convictions that you so
passionately believe would have been a completely different, and largely
contradictory, set of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a
different place. <span class="GramE">Epidemiology, not evidence.
� Richard Dawkins
<span style>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mystery generates wonder, and wonder generates awe. The gasp can terrify or the
gasp can emancipate. As I allow myself to experience cosmic and quantum Mystery,

<p>&quot;How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief
sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it.
But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for
other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own
happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose
destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I
remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men,
living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same
measure as I have received and am still receiving... <br>
&quot;I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this
critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my
way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have
been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like
mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally
unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have
seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward
success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible. <br>
&quot;My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always
contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other
human beings and human communities. I am truly a 'lone traveler' and have never
belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with
my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of
distance and a need for solitude...&quot;
<p>-from &quot;The World as I See It&quot;, by Albert Einstein
<p align="justify"><font size="3"></b>My Credo</b><i> (1932</i>)</font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">&quot;It is a special blessing to belong among
those who can and may devote their best energies to the contemplation and
exploration of objective and timeless things. How happy and grateful I am for
having been granted this blessing, which bestows upon one a large measure of
independence from one's personal fate and from the attitude of one's
contemporaries. Yet this independence must not inure us to the awareness of the
duties that constantly bind us to the past, present and future of humankind at
large.<br>
Our situation on this earth seems strange. Every one of us appears here,
involuntarily and uninvited, for a short stay, without knowing the why and the
wherefore. In our daily lives we feel only that man is here for the sake of
others, for those whom we love and for many other beings whose fate is connected
with our own. I am often troubled by the thought that my life is based to such a
large extent on the work of my fellow human beings, and I am aware of my great
indebtedness to them.<br>
I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants,
but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations throughout my
life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather
painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking
myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and
from losing my temper.<br>
I have never coveted affluence and luxury and even despise them a good deal. My
passion for social justice has often brought me into conflict with people, as
has my aversion to any obligation and dependence I did not regard as absolutely
necessary. I have a high regard for the individual and an insuperable distaste
for violence and fanaticism. All these motives have made me a passionate
pacifist and antimilitarist. I am against any chauvinism, even in the guise of
mere patriotism.<br>
Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and
pernicious, as does any exaggerated personality cult. I am an adherent of the
ideal of democracy, although I know well the weaknesses of the democratic form
of government. Social equality and economic protection of the individual have
always seemed to me the important communal aims of the state.<br>
Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to
the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice keeps
me from feeling isolated.<br>
The most beautiful and deepest experience a man can have is the sense of the
mysterious. It is the underlying principle of religion as well as of all serious
endeavor in art and science. He who never had this experience seems to me, if
not dead, then at least blind. To sense that behind anything that can be
experienced there is a something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and
sublimely reaches us only indirectly: this is religiousness. In this sense I am
religious. To me it suffices to wonder at these secrets and to attempt humbly to
grasp with my mind a mere image of the lofty structure of all there is.&quot;<br>
-Albert Einstein&nbsp;<br>

Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human

paradise was not as comforting and alluring as the road to the religious
paradise; but it has proved itself as trustworthy, and I have never regretted

  <li>&quot;Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more
  violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the
  opposite direction.&quot; </li>

  <li>&quot;I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.&quot; </li>

  <li>&quot;Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.&quot;

  <li>&quot;The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates
  empirically.&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday

  <li>&quot;Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.&quot;

  <li>&quot;The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is

  <li>&quot;We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when

  <li>&quot;Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned

  <li>&quot;Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you

  <li>&quot;Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present,

  <li>&quot;If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is

  <li>&quot;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not

You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt
and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it�s much more interesting to live not
knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers
and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different
things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I
don�t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we�re
here�I don�t have to know an answer. I don�t feel frightened not knowing things,
by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it
really is as far as I can tell. It doesn�t frighten me.<br>
� Richard P. Feynman</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">A poet once said, �The whole universe is in
a glass of wine.� We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for
poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass
of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of
physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather,
the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a
distillation of the earth�s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of
the universe�s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange <span class="GramE">
array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are
the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is
found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover
the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of
much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the
consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide
this glass of wine, this universe, into parts � physics, biology, geology,
astronomy, psychology, and so on � remember that nature does not know it! So let
us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it
give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!<br>
� Richard P. Feynman&nbsp;</font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Poets say science takes away from the beauty
of the stars � mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is �<span class="GramE">mere.�
I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or
more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination � stuck on this
carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern � of
which I am a part � perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as
one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all
apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What
is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery
to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists
of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men
are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an
immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">
We have a way of discussing the world, when we talk of it at various
hierarchies, or levels. Now I do not mean to be very precise, dividing the world
into definite levels, but I will indicate, by describing a set of ideas, what I
mean by hierarchies of ideas.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">For example, at one end we have the
fundamental laws of physics. Then we invent other terms for concepts which are
approximate, which have, we believe, their ultimate explanation in terms of the
fundamental laws. For instance, �heat.� Heat is supposed to be jiggling, and the
word for a hot thing is just the word for a mass of atoms which are jiggling.
But for a while, if we are talking about heat, we sometimes forget about the
atoms jiggling � just as when we talk about the glacier we do not always think
of the hexagonal ice and the snowflakes which originally fell. Another example
of the same thing is a salt crystal. Looked at fundamentally it is a lot of
protons, neutrons, and electrons; but we have this concept of �salt crystal,�
which carries a whole pattern already of fundamental interactions. An idea like
pressure is the same.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Now if we go higher up from this, in
another level we have properties of substances � like �refractive index,� how
light is bent when it goes through something; or �surface tension,� the fact
that water tends to pull itself together, both of which are described by
numbers. I remind you that we have to go through several laws down to find out
that it is the pull of the atoms, and so on. But we still say �surface tension,�
and do not always worry, when discussing surface tension, about the inner
workings.</font><span style><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">On, up in the hierarchy. With the water
we have waves, and we have a thing like a storm, the word �storm� which
represents an enormous mass of phenomena, or a �sun spot,� or �star,� which is
an accumulation of things. And it is not worthwhile always to think of it way
back. In fact we cannot, because the higher up we go the more steps we have in
between, each one of which is a little weak. We have not thought them all
through yet.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we go up in this hierarchy of complexity, we get to things
like muscle twitch, or nerve impulse, which is an enormously complicated thing
in the physical world, involving an organization of matter in a very elaborate
complexity. Then <span class="GramE">come things like �frog.�<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we go on, and we come to words and concepts like
�man,� and �history,� or �political expediency,� and so forth, a series of
concepts which we use to understand things at an ever higher level.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going on, we come to things like evil, and beauty, and
hope�<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which end is nearer to God, if I may use a religious
metaphor, beauty and hope, or the fundamental laws? I think that the right way,
of course, is to say that what we have to look at is the whole structural
interconnection of the thing; and that all the sciences, and not just the
sciences but all the efforts of intellectual kinds, are an <span class="SpellE">
endeavor to see the connections of the hierarchies, to connect beauty to
history, to connect history to man�s psychology, man�s psychology to the working
of the brain, the brain to the neural impulse, the neural impulse to the
chemistry, and so forth, up and down, both ways. And today we cannot, and it is
no use making believe that we can, draw carefully a line all the way from one
end of this thing to the other, because we have only just begun to see that
there is this relative hierarchy.<span style><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I do not think either end is nearer to God. To stand at
either end, and to walk off that end of the pier only, hoping that out in that
direction is the complete understanding, is a mistake. And to stand with evil
and beauty and hope, or to stand with the fundamental laws, hoping that way to
get a deep understanding of the whole world, with that aspect alone, is a
mistake. It is not sensible for the ones who specialize at the other end, to
have such disregard for each other. (They don�t actually, but people say they
do.) The great mass of workers in between, connecting one step to another, are
improving all the time our understanding of the world, both from working at the
ends and working in the middle, and in that way we are gradually understanding
this tremendous world of interconnecting hierarchies.<br>

&nbsp;</b>Science</b>
It is the sense of mystery
that, in my opinion, drives the true scientist; the same blind force, blindly
seeing, deafly hearing, unconsciously remembering<span class="GramE">,
that drives the larva into the butterfly. If [the scientist] has not
experienced, at least a few times in his life, this cold shudder down his spine,
this confrontation with an immense invisible face whose breath moves him to
tears, he is not a scientist.
