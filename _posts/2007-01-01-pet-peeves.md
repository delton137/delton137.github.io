Some things I don't like.  

-- People who use all caps in internet discussions.  
-- People who don't leave time to figure out the projector before their presentation.  
-- People who are arrogant.  
-- People who curse unnecessarily.  
-- People who play loud music in their cars with the windows down, especially after midnight.  
-- People who purposefully make their car/motorcycle really loud on purpose.  
-- People who yell and scream outside past midnight.  
-- People who talk in libraries without consideration for others.  
-- People who assume I am smarter than I am or make other assumptions.  
-- People who don't write their name legibly.  
-- People who try to text and walk at the same time (or worse, text and drive).  
-- People who smoke.  
-- Paths that are not designed with efficiency in mind.  
-- Sticky residues on books.
