ABSTRACT = {Traditionally, atherosclerotic risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer are assessed using coronary artery calcium scoring. However, this neglects the impact of atherosclerotic disease more proximal to the cancer site. This study assesses whether aortoiliac atherosclerotic plaque is associated with prostate cancer. The dataset consisted of abdominopelvic CT of 93 patients with prostate cancer and 186 asymptomatic patients who underwent CT colonography as an age- and gender-matched control group. Agatston scores were measured in the abdominal aorta, common iliac, and internal iliac arteries. The scores were evaluated for associations with age, Framingham risk score, and prostate cancer-related biomarkers, including prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, tumor location, prostatectomy, androgen deprivation therapy, mortality, and bone metastasis. The atherosclerotic plaque of prostate cancer patients did not differ from the control group (p = 0.22) and was not correlated with any of the prostate cancer-related biomarkers (p > 0.05). However, Agatston scores of abdominal plaques correlated well with age (p < 0.001) and Framingham risk scores (p = 0.002).},
